> Q) _Why do I need this ?_
>
> &nbsp;If you want to write down your thoughts that no one else should be able to read. So, create a mapping of English alphabet with random unicode characters.
>
> You will memorize them by frequent use.
>
> Q) _I can draw some random lines on paper and that can be my script, right ?_
>
> &nbsp; Sure. This tool gives interface for that. Instead of random lines, you choose from Unicode characters because they can be typed and printed.

## How?

Collect Unicode character codepoints from [unicode-table](https://unicode-table.com/) or anywhere.

In the app, change keyboard config with Unicodes in "U+1234" or "1234" format for each letter.

## Roadmap

Development just started. Current version is just beta with basics.

Following features may be expected.

* Update keyboard mapping from file
* Random key mapping generation
* Better print to pdf
* Better UI
* Save written documents to cloud
